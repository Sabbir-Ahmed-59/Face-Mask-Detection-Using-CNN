# Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detection
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO emphasized the importance of wearing masks to protect against the virus. In response to this mandate, we developed a machine learning project called Real-Time Face Mask Detection using Python, OpenCV, and Keras.

This project leverages Python, Keras, and OpenCV to build a deep learning model capable of identifying whether a person is wearing a face mask. The face mask detector was trained using Keras with a carefully designed network architecture to ensure accurate and reliable predictions.


# Importance of Real-Time Face Mask Detection Python

Face coverings help reduce the volume and travel distance of exhaled droplets during talking, breathing, or coughing. Masks without vents or holes effectively filter virus-carrying particles from both inhaled and exhaled air, thereby reducing the risk of infection.

# Major Functionalities

Real-Time Camera Display: The system provides a live feed from the camera in real time.
Face Detection: The system identifies and detects faces within the live camera feed.
Mask Detection: The system determines whether or not a person is wearing a face mask based on the detected faces.
